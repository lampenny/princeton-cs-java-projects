# Discrete distribution

### Probablity theory

Probability is a mathematical concept for measuring the likelihood of an event occurring. In other words, probability quantifies how likely an event is to occur on a scale from 0 to 1. Zero means impossibility, and 1 indicates certainty. Probability is expressed as a fraction, decimal number, or percentage.

Formula: The probability of an event occurring is calculated like this.

`P = Number of favourable outcomes / Total number of outcomes`​
 
Example: In flipping a coin, these are the values for calculating the probability of getting a head.

Number of Favorable Outcomes = 1 (there’s one head)
Total Number of Outcomes = 2 (there’s one head and one tail)

The probability is:

`P = 1 / 2 = 0.5 = 50%`

### In probability theory, this is known as sampling from a discrete distribution.

A probability distribution is a mathematical representation of the probabilities of all possible outcomes for a random variable in a given scenario. In other words, it defines how the likelihood of each possible outcome is distributed across the range of values that the random variable can take. "discrete" refers to a type of variable that can take on a countable number of distinct values. 
This means the values are separate and not continuous; for example, the number of heads when flipping a coin can be 0, 1, or 2, but not 1.5. 

```How Do You Know If a Distribution Is Discrete?
The data are discrete if there are only a set array of possible outcomes (e.g., zero, one, or only integers).
