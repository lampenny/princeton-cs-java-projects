# Conditionals and Loops

## 2. Band Matrices

Write a program `BandMatrix.java` that takes two integer command-line arguments `n` and `width` and prints an n-by-n pattern like the ones below, with a zero (0) for each element whose distance from the main diagonal is strictly more than width, and an asterisk (*) for each entry that is not, and two spaces between each 0 or *.

## 3. Random Walker

Write a program `RandomWalker.java` that takes an integer command-line argument `r` and `simulates` the motion of a random walk until the random walker is at Manhattan distance `r` from the starting point. Print the coordinates at each step of the walk (including the starting and ending points), treating the starting point as `(0, 0)`. Also, print the total number of steps taken.


### Key takeaways/refreshers from these assignments

- `h += x` is shorthand for `h = h + x`
- `Math.pow(i, r)` calculates the value of i raised to the power of r so if `i` is 2 and `r` is 3, exponente would be `2 x 2 x 2 = 8` aka exponentiation
